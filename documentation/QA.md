# Trigger Output FMC Quality Assurance Procedure

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to have a consistent unified way each Board is tested before deployment. This procedure will be updated periodically to improve QA of the boards.

## Equipment Needed

* Multimeter (Fluke 115 or better)
* Triple output Benchtop Power Supply
* Oscilloscope with 125MHz+ bandwidth
* FMC Power breakout module [link](https://www.iamelectronic.com/shop/produkt/fpga-mezzanine-card-fmc-power-module/)
* Marble Testing Chassis
* PC to run IOC and Phoebus

## Procedure

### QA Metadata

* **Board Serial Number:**
* **PCB Revision:**
* **IOC URL:**
* **IOC Commit:**
* **Firmware URL:**
* **Firmware Commit:**

### Visual Inspection

Check visual for any board defects. If the board has come back from rework look at the reworked areas carefully under magnification for any shorts etc.

Areas to check with extra scrutiny are around the clock jitter cleaner components.

* **Notes / Defects:**

### Power Testing

Next the Board will be powered up in various ways to protect other testing hardware.

### Looking for Shorts to GND

Using the multimeter check that all voltage test points have a resistance to board ground greater than 1kΩ.

### 12V/3.3V/2.5V Power Testing

One at a time inject 12V, 3.3V & 2.5V using the voltage test points found on the board. Do this with a 1.5A current limit.

Note variance from nominal current if found.

| Rail | Nominal Expected | Measured Current | Notes / Variance |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 12V  | ~50mA            |                  |                  |
| 3.3V | ~70mA            |                  |                  |
| 2.5V | ~4mA             |                  |                  |

### FMC Breakout Power Testing

Using a 3 output power supply and two FMC Power breakout modules: Power up all input power rails (12V/3.3V/2.5V) simultaneously.

Note variance from nominal current if found.

| Rail | Nominal Expected | Measured Current | Notes / Variance |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 12V  | ~50mA            |                  |                  |
| 3.3V | ~70mA            |                  |                  |
| 2.5V | ~4mA             |                  |                  |

### Power Up with Marble

Attach a now power tested board to a **powered off** marble testing chassis.

1. Power up the testing chassis.
2. Start the IOC.
3. Ensure proper readback of diagnostic signals (voltage, etc.).

### EEPROM Programmed

Checkout the branch/revision appropriate to the PCB model to be programmed, and edit `createEEPROMs.sh` with the appropriate serial numbers.

### Signal Check - Clock Routing

1. Ensure the chassis under test is in EVG mode and Clk Source is set to Int. 125MHz.
2. Set both Jitter Cleaner to default configuration (IN:125MHz ; OUT:125MHz|62.5MHz):
   * Using the FPGA console run`jtr1 cfg` to set up the first jitter cleaner.
   * Using the FPGA console run`jtr2 cfg` to set up the second jitter cleaner.
3. Using an Oscilloscope, check the clock test ports:
   * CLK1 should be 125MHz.
   * CLK2 should be 62.5MHz.
   * CLK3 should be 125MHz.
   * CLK4 should be 62.5MHz.
4. Using the FPGA console run fmon to see that clocks are read back by the FPGA
   * `FMC2.0 MGT REF2` clock should read 125MHz
   * `FMC2.1 MGT REF3` clock should read 125MHz
   * `FMC2 CLN0` clock should read 125MHz
   * `FMC2 CLN1` clock should read 125MHz

### Signal Check - Digital Outputs

1. For each Digital Output set up and send an event stream turning all outputs on and off at 1Hz.
2. Force 0/1.
3. Look at each of the 16 outputs to ensure compliance.

**Channels Checked:**

| Channels 0–7 | Channels 8–15 |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ch 0: [ ] Pass | Ch 8: [ ] Pass |
| Ch 1: [ ] Pass | Ch 9: [ ] Pass |
| Ch 2: [ ] Pass | Ch 10: [ ] Pass |
